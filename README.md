## 🚧 AI-Powered Multi-Tenant SaaS Platform (Work in Progress)

This repository contains a **production-grade Django SaaS application** that I am **currently building**.

The goal of this project is to design and implement **real-world backend systems** while covering **commonly asked interview concepts** in Django, system design, DSA, and GenAI.

---

### 🎯 Project Objective
To build a **scalable, multi-tenant SaaS platform** with:-  
- Secure authentication & authorization  
- Organization-level data isolation  
- Async background processing  
- AI-powered workflows using **LangChain & LangGraph**

Each module is intentionally designed to reflect **real engineering decisions** and **backend interview questions**.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Django, Django REST Framework  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL  
- **Auth:** JWT, Role-Based Access Control  
- **Async:** Celery, Redis / RabbitMQ
